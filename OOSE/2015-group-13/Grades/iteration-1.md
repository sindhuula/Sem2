## Positive Points:
* Your screenshots looked awesome, and your project description is very readable.

## Things to Improve:
### Use Cases
* Please number the steps in your use cases.
* In the normal battleship game, players are notified when a battleship is sunk. Your use cases and feature lists did not mention these features.

*(-3 points)*.

### UI Sketches
* Placing pieces on the board should be more explicitly shown both in the screenshots and in the game flow diagram.
* Your screenshots should reflect what the phone's actual orientation will be.
* The small boards on the right seem redundant?

*(-1 Points)*

### State Diagram
* This is a useful diagram. However it seems to be missing a state where you place ships prior to starting the actual game.

## Additional Notes:
* If you haven't already decided to do so, you should use Spark instead of Spring.
* Your features seem like they might not take too long to implement. As we discussed during class, consider adding more extended features such as different gameplay modes. E.g. a line-of-sight mode or extended rules that allow (small) movements of battleships.

**Grade: 96/100**
